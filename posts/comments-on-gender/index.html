    <h1>comments on gender in modernity</h1>
    
    <div class="blog-post-content">
        <blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;a day may soon come in which a healthy transexuality would be the norm&rdquo; &ndash; Firestone</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a certain contradiction in transsexual discourse I&rsquo;ve noticed. On one hand, gender is a social construct based on patriarchal power that ought to be abolished. On the other, gender is an unchangeable and <em>a priori</em> subjectivity in which ought to be accepted. A malleable social construction and a rigid authentic identity.</p>
<p>Of course, we can try to synthesize them: Patriarchy is bad but gender is good. But then we have to deal with the question of gender. It seems many people have moved past a purely biological judgement (i.e. males have XY chromosomes, females have XX chromosomes) due to its inadequacy to capture the surplus (intersex).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Identity categories are never merely descriptive, but always normative, and as such, exclusionary&rdquo; &ndash; Butler</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historically, we&rsquo;ve used sex organs or sexuality to mark the distinction. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what is used: to split a whole into a binary will end up with exceptions or a useless tautology (there only exists X and not-X). However, some people who hold anti-biological essentialist ideas end up reaffirming a form of gender essentialism by deferring it towards self-identification: &ldquo;I identify (as X), therefore I am (X)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>First, ontology is boring, especially if it&rsquo;s static. Go back to Plato.</p>
<p>Second, the sex&ndash;gender distinction conceals knowledge production. The idea of gender being social/subjective and sex being biological/objective obscures the fact that biology is a discourse too, and thus, social as well. Science is never pre-ideological; or, humans create biology and not biology humans. To defer capital-t Truth to capital-s Science is to reproduce capital&rsquo;s power structures (phrenology comes to mind here). Ideology will always be perceived as natural. This isn&rsquo;t to say there aren&rsquo;t practical sexual differences (medicine would be more difficult otherwise), but it&rsquo;s immanent and not transcendent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The ideology of sexual difference functions as censorship in our culture by masking, on the ground of nature, the social opposition between men and women. Masculine/feminine, male/female are the categories which serve to conceal the fact that social differences always belong to an economic, political, ideological order&rdquo; &ndash; Wittig</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any attempts to categorize people by sex or gender ends with unintentional side effects. Common examples are castrated men being considered women (“men produce sperm”) or women with PCOS being considered men (“women don’t look like that”). TERFs end up <a href="https://twitter.com/SomeBWord/status/1279586291173163015">tripping over themselves</a>. I understand their suspicion though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;What seems to take place outside ideology (to be precise, in the street), in reality takes place in ideology [..] ideology never says, ‘I am ideological.'&rdquo; &ndash; Althusser</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this attacks the TERF “sex-not-gender” argument, this also attacks many pro-trans arguments e.g. a neuro-essentialist model of gender (“It’s just brain chemistry”, “I was born this way”). The argument “you can’t hate someone for being LGBT, because they were born that way” masks over a deeper, darker belief: &ldquo;if they could change it, they should&rdquo;. Would a more radical position not be <em>“hate all you want, but they are a product of society, this is the path society is going, and there is nothing you can do to change it</em>”?</p>
<p>This is why Blanchard must be saved from the TERFs. Blanchard views transsexualism under the lens of desire, i.e., a process. There are many reasons people give for transitioning (“I was born a man in a woman’s body”), but all of them can be reduced to the level of desire. No metaphysics needed!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Essentialist naturalism reeks of theology–the sooner it is exorcised, the better&rdquo; &ndash; Cuboniks</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People tend to reject this because the connotations of the autogynephilic as a pervert, but is that not all gender? Everybody is a pervert in the sense we discriminate on desire outside utilitarian reasons. Freud spoke of kissing being perverted: <em>“No healthy person, it appears, can fail to make some addition that might be called perverse to the normal sexual aim</em>”. In fact, the autogynephilic self-objectification might literally be the definition of any identity: &ldquo;<em>this is how I want to exist in the realm of desire</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are all perverts! We are all libidos that are too viscous and too fluid &ndash; and not by preference, but wherever we have been carried by the deterritorialized flows&rdquo; &ndash; Deleuze &amp; Guattari</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what can describe this rise of transsexualism? Are transphobes right about it  being the increased media attention that makes people transition? Maybe, but that&rsquo;s too specific. In either way, I think it&rsquo;s a response to late capitalism.</p>
<p>Capitalism degrading the quality of life is nothing new. Increasing stress of modern life could produce dysphoria (or as Marx would call it: alienation). In fact, Marx sounds like he&rsquo;s describing the born-in-the-wrong-body metaphor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The alienation of the [transsexual] in his [body] means not only that his [gender] becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him&rdquo; &ndash; Marx</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ICD-11 describes dysphoria as “an unpleasant mood state, which can include feelings of depression, anxiety, discontent, irritability, and unhappiness”. No matter what political position one holds, I think many will agree this is a common sentiment of modernity. From communists to fascists to feminists to incels, there is clearly something wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Considering mental illness an individual chemico-biological problem has enormous benefits for capitalism. First, it reinforces capital’s drive towards atomistic individualization (you are sick because of your brain chemistry). Second, it provides an enormously lucrative market in which multinational pharmaceutical companies can peddle their pharmaceuticals (we can cure you with our SSRIs).&rdquo; – Mark Fisher</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before knowing what communism is, we are taught that communism is totalitarian/despotic/evil and all forms of identity are lost (I&rsquo;ve heard people say communism turns people into cogs for the state machine). Capitalism, so they say, gives us the freedom to be ourselves. The possibility of communism becomes repressed. As we grow, we fall emotionally ill (alienated, dysphoric, etc). I think being unable to articulate a better society turns the repressed inwards: “Capitalism is correct, therefore the issue is with me”. It&rsquo;s much easier to change genders than to change the mode of production.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;the more a man controls his aggressiveness, the more intense becomes his ideal&rsquo;s inclination to aggressiveness against his ego. It is like a displacement, a turning round upon his own ego.&rdquo; &ndash; Freud</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What about the increased manufacturing under late capitalism (where consumption is privileged over production)? <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222987/">Plastics are shown to have estrogenic activity</a>. Climate change caused from overproduction are <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/climate-change-producing-too-many-female-sea-turtles-180967780/">turning Turtles female</a>. The sexual revolution didn&rsquo;t just happen in the 60s: it was there since capitalism.</p>
<p>The notion of gender has also changed drastically. With the conception of demigenders, gender fluidity, and so on, identity has played a primary role. Could these novel forms of gender could be due the atomization effects from capitalism? To be clear, this isn&rsquo;t a moral criticism, and it&rsquo;s not a bad thing. I just want to be critical of the power at play.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Do not demand of politics that it restore the “rights” of the individual, as philosophy has defined them. The individual is the product of power. What is needed is to &lsquo;de-individualize&rsquo; by means of multiplication and displacement, diverse combinations&rdquo; &ndash; Foucault</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People becoming <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/06/generational-politics-millennials-zoomers-socialism">more and more radical</a> could mean the threat of the despot&rsquo;s castration (be it the father or the state) is less and less inhibitory. The trans-feminine transexualization results in an affirmation of castration: &ldquo;Yes I will disobey; castrate me all you want!&rdquo;</p>
<p>People being unable to form proper identities from rapid exposure of advertisements and mass media to further profit could also be a cause. Ask Jonah Peretti, the co-founder of BuzzFeed. The lines between male and female blur as women enter the post-war workforce. Birth control means the conception of the female isn&rsquo;t chained down to motherhood. The traditional nuclear family of a working father and stay-at-home mother is disappearing as capital finds new avenues to counteract tendency of the rate of profit to fall. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/234863/estimate-lgbt-population-rises.aspx">People are becoming more queer</a>. The traditional male economic, social, and sexual roles are failing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Identity formation is inextricably linked to the urge to consume, and therefore the acceleration of capitalism necessitates an increase in the rate at which individuals assume and shed identities&rdquo; &ndash; Jonah Peretti</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying capitalism is turning people transgender and post-capitalist production will abolish this transsexual process. I&rsquo;m merely stating the deterritorialization of gender caused by capitalism is a pattern that seems apparent. I would even go as far to say that it&rsquo;s a specifically trans-feminizing force. Perhaps this would explain the trend of trans women becoming highly-paid software engineers while men increasingly struggle to find their own subjectivity (PUAs, red-pill, incels). In a way, all of this is (gender(ed)) dysphoria, but the only one increasing in power is the trans-feminine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;sperm count fell, birth rates crashed, and the hormonal energy and muscular strength which served [men] so well were now becoming liabilities&rdquo; &ndash; Plant</em></p>
